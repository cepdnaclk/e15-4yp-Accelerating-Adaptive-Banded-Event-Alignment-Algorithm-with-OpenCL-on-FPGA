## Abstract
Nanopore sequencing is a third-generation sequencing technology that can analyze long DNA, RNA fragments
in real-time. It measures the change in electrical current as
nucleic acids pass through a protein nanopore. The Nanopolish
software package utilizes the aforementioned signal level changes
to obtain useful results in oxford nanopore DNA sequencing.
Adaptive Banded Event Alignment (ABEA) is a dynamic programming algorithm used in nanopolish software packages to
polish sequencing data and identify nano-strand nucleotides
such as measuring DNA methylation. Prior investigations show
that ABEA consumes 70% of total CPU time in nanopolish.
Thus, we identified optimizing the ABEA algorithm as vital
for nanopore sequencing applications. OpenCL(Open Computing
Language) is currently one of the fastest-growing high-level
synthesis frameworks in the FPGA domain. OpenCL enables
programming in high-level languages such as C, C++ and those
programs are converted to run on heterogeneous CPU, GPU,
and FPGA systems. In this study, we parallelize and optimize
the implementation of the ABEA algorithm to run efficiently on
FPGAs using OpenCL
